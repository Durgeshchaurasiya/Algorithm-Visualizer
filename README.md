# Algorithm Visualizer

This is a simple web-based Algorithm Visualizer that helps visualize sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. It's a great tool to understand how these algorithms work step-by-step.

# Features

Generate New Array: Creates a new set of random bars with varying heights.

Algorithm Selection: Choose from Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, or Insertion Sort.

Visual Sorting: Watch how each algorithm sorts the array with color-coded animations.

# Technologies Used

HTML5: Structure of the web page.

CSS3: Styling and basic animations.

JavaScript: Logic for generating arrays and implementing sorting algorithms.

# How to Run the Project
